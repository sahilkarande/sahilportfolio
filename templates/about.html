<section class="about-text">
                  <p>I am a Computer Engineering graduate currently enrolled in the Diploma in Big Data Analytics (DBDA) program at CDAC Mumbai-Kharghar. With a strong foundation in data science, analytics, and data engineering, I bring hands-on experience from internships at Solar Industries India Ltd. and Clustor Computing. At Solar Industries, I contributed as an IoT Intern by improving manufacturing processes through real-time dashboards using Power BI and Excel. At Clustor Computing, I focused on creating dynamic dashboards and visual reports to support business intelligence.</p>
                  <p>My technical journey includes key academic and personal projects such as “InsightHub: Your Personal Data Analytics Companion,” a Streamlit-based data analysis platform, and “Stock Market Prediction of BSE and NSE Companies” using ML algorithms. I am currently working on end-to-end case studies involving Linear and Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python, pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn. My expertise continues to grow in big data tools such as Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, and MongoDB, integrated with platforms like AWS and S3 for scalable solutions.</p>
                  <p>As the Technical Class Representative at CDAC, I actively contribute to academic coordination and project mentoring. My leadership experience is complemented by previous involvement with Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC), where I organized impactful seminars and workshops. I remain committed to continuous learning and development in data engineering, cloud computing, and machine learning technologies.</p>
                  <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I am eager to connect with like-minded professionals and collaborate on innovative solutions in the evolving landscape of big data and AI-driven analytics.</p>
